# Open-Fantasy-Football
Open based platform for real football fans to collaborate on a great Fantasy Football experience

Hello Open Community !  My name is Darren Cottel and I have been an avid NFL Football fan for most of my life starting very young.  I have been playing Fantasy Football (no money) leagues and have been the commissioner of a Yahoo! league for about 4 years.  Most of my family plays, and I have other parents/young adult kids playing in our league which has now become very competitive !  In searching for other league platforms, I have found that their interfaces are un-inspiring and stagnate.  I've recently been laid off and have some extra time to devote to my passion, and nothing makes me feel like an excited kid, like NFL Football!  Great memories, and competitive spirit get me sucked in everytime.

I've been in technology for about 20+ years and am familiar with infrastructure, however I do not code. I wanted to create an OPEN platform where excited and passionate Football Fans can have a great experience and contribute to the overall experience. I am hoping this community can help me along my journey, contribute to the success of the platform, and ultimately share in that success!

Some obervations of the industry NFL Fantasy Football platforms - 

Provides lack luster graphics and themes for extreme Fans
Fans don’t access sites except to change their lineup once a week 
Themes are generic and lack enthusiasm for the Fan
Multiple disparate game sites
Can't really talk smack with friends during the games, or during the week
No real time game action, except to watch single players in different games
No repetitive awards or bonuses to keep players engaged (Fortnite model)
Content is not updated enough to keep players engaged
Multiple disparate news sources without real intelligent "True Source Leaders" (Jane Slater, Ian Rapport, etc….based on teams(twitter, NFL reports, reddit, fan blogs etc..)
Mobile app content is lackluster and doesn’t allow for teammates to interact real-time (except to text natively from IOS or Droid)
Content is game site specific to whichever genre or flavor of game site your league is in….cant play across games platforms (NFL, ESPN, Yahoo, CBS, draft kings, etc)

Some general ideas to start with, but needs additional work to flush out pyschology of the game, potential business cases etc to keep the site self funded.

Cool/style based avatars, bonuses, game unlocks, for content creation (pay for these items when new "Cool Ones" come out)	
	Individual player or team logos
	NFL player and Team icons
	Highlights of exceptional plays that beat opponents
	Team "Crushing" skits or small clips of animated content
	Awards for Earning additional content based on various acheivements (most points for a player, waiver wire pickups, etc...
	Automated News based on roster 
	Real time video, audio for drafts where people can interact from different parts of world (webex, zoom, google, amazon etc…)
	Community designs can be added to a "Marketplace" for a piece of the action
Real Time game data feeds - specific to your team	
	
Community Content can be submitted by Fans of their teams and uploaded….then their relevance is voted upon (upvotes and down votes for relevance)

Gamers can import their Yahoo!, NFL, CBS, ESPN, teams into this platform through the sites IAM, and not HAVE to switch to this specific platform for game hosting.  They can have that option, but the goal here is to allow them to import their leagues, for a richer experience.

Problem and challenges to Project:

Need to design and develop on a platform or languages that allows the most access to the open community, for artisitc content creation, mobile applications, real time data feeds for new game concept, interactions of players during games, continous development for new avatars, bonuses, etc.

The infrastructure and hosting the site is something that I can work through when further development and requirements are flushed out, and thats where I can contribute significantly.  I need help with the above challenges and would welcome ANY suggestions and guidence.

If you are a dire hard football fan I want you to bring your passion to this project !!!!   I would like to target having this ready for rollout by the beginning of next season...August 2019 time frame.

More to follow....Darren
